*   Japan and China are engaged in a new diplomatic standoff concerning Taiwan, sparked by a statement from Japan's new Prime Minister, Sanai Takayichi.
*   Prime Minister Takayichi declared that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could constitute a "survival-threatening situation" for Japan, signaling a significant shift in Tokyo's security posture.
*   This statement draws on a 2015 law allowing Japan's self-defense forces to act in collective defense, even if Japan is not directly attacked.
*   Beijing swiftly condemned Takayichi's remarks as "wrongful and dangerous," lodging a strong protest with Tokyo.
*   The dispute escalated when a Chinese diplomat posted an online threat, leading to outrage in Japan and a formal protest from Tokyo demanding an explanation.
*   Japan, while reaffirming its "One China" policy, emphasized that peace in the Taiwan Strait is crucial for international security.
*   Taiwan criticized China's "wolf warrior diplomacy" for crossing a line, and the US ambassador to Tokyo also labeled the Chinese diplomat's post as a "threat."
*   The tensions highlight Taiwan's critical geographic proximity to Japan's vital sea lanes, underscoring the fragility of Japan-China relations and regional stability.
